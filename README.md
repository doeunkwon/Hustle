# ðŸ’¸ Hustle

> The time wallet that keeps you on the go.

### Motivation

At the start of every day, everyone is given the same allowance of 24 hours to spend. Time is money, but unlike money, many people unknowingly waste time. This is perhaps because there are various tools used to budget and manage cash, but there're no such tools truly dedicated for time. Inspired by the movie "In Time" by Andrew Niccol, Hustle is an attempt to materialize this abstract phenomenon and give it the attention that it deserves.

### Description

Hustle's main objective is to separate between time that is free and - for a lack of better word - forced. The key functions of the app are: 1. save and lock away time, and 2. spend time on work or school or any other mandatory events and keep a receipt of these transactions. Users can peg daily events so that they're aware of how much time is spent on repeating events every day, and spend additional time on other events while keeping an eye on the remaining hours. Yes. This does sound a lot like a watch. But unlike a watch that focuses on how much time has passed, Hustle places the importance on how much of the 24 hour allowance remains and can be used for future opportunities.
